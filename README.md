# Robust-Streaming-Tensor-Factorization-via-Online-Variational-Bayesian-Inference
This repository contains the project report for our work on Tensor Factorisation using a first order autoregressive model. Our main contribution can be found in Section 3.D where we have formulated a method for updates of the temporal component, when the non temporal component is expressed using CP decomposition.
The code for the above proposed model is currently being written in MATLAB and will soon be uploaded.
